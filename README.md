# A-CVAE-Based-Anomaly-Detection-Algorithm-for-Cyber-Physical-Attacks-on-Water-Distribution-Systems
Developed an AI-powered anomaly detection system using Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to detect and mitigate cyber-physical attacks in Water Distribution Systems (WDS). The model enhances security by identifying abnormal behavior in IoT-enabled water infrastructure with 98% accuracy.
